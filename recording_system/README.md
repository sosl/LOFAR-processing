LOFAR recording system scripts

Most of the scripts here were not originally written by me. However, all the scripts which are in use have been modified by me, sometimes quite heavily, and sometimes completely rewritten.

The credit for the original scripts goes to James M. Anderson, Andreas Horneffer, Joris Verbiest, and possibly others (Olaf Wucknitz, Masaya Kunioshi, Aris Noutsos).
